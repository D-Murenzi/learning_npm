This repository contains all my work as I learn about package management
and frontend development tools setup.
among the tools includes but not limited to:
1.Git and Github
2.npm
3.prettier
4.eslint
5.vite

This project comes after learning how to build projects using react,
so it serves as toolchain that will allow me to setup my environment for development, transformation and deployment of my work online.
